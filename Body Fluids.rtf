The fundamental prinicple:\par
At all levels of organization, functional activities are directed at maintaining HOMEOSTASIS, the relative constancy of the "milieu interieur"\par
\par
Claude Bernard found:\par
1. The envionment surrounding individual ceels is vastly different fom the external environment \par
2. The internal environment emains relatively constant under conditions of health\par
\par
The milieu inteieur includes vaious body fluids\par

\par
WATER is the most abundant single constituent of the body\par
we ae all 45-75% water\par
\par
Body water is the medium which\par
\tab dissolves solutes\par
\tab where metabolic reactions take place\par
\tab regulate body temperature\par
\tab lubricates joints\par
\tab helps prevent constipation\par
\tab lessens burdens on kidneys and liver \par
\par
% of water in various tissues\par
\par
\tab skin ~ 70%\par
\tab muscle ~ 75% wate\par
\tab heart, liver, brain kidney ~ 70-80%\par
\tab bone ~ 25%\par
\tab fat (adipose tissue) ~ 10%\par
\par
body fat percentage is the primary determiner of a peson's proportion of body water\par
\par
standard ~ 60% body water\par
obese ~ 45% body water\par
thin ~ 75% body water\par
\par
If body water content is computed as a fraction of lean body mass, it should be pretty similar accrros all people \par
\par
Standard values for a physiological reference individual\par
\tab 21 year old, white male, 70 kg\par
\par
Now we realize we must adjust for age, sex, weight \par
\par
Newborn babies have about 75% body water\par
At puberty, females and males diverge\par
\par
Female ~ 50%\par
Male ~ 60% \par
\par
Elederly\par
Male ~ 50%\par
Female ~ 45%\par
\par
With age lean muscle is lost with age and rerplaced by dry connective tissue\par
\par
REALLY IMPORTANT\par
\par
For a 70kg male who is 60% water there is 42L of water\par
\par
For 60kg female who is 50% water, 30L of water\par
For 70kg female who is 50% water, 35L\par
\par
Knowing the amount of body water is important when administering  water-soluble medication\par
\par
10mg / 7kg \par
70kg male = 42L water -=42000ml\par
administer 100mg\par
final concentration 100/42000 = 0.0024mg/ml (2.4 ug/ml)\par
\par
for 70kg female, 35L waterr \par
00029mg/ml (2.9 ug/ml)\par
\par
70kg elderly female 3.2ug/ml\par
\par
70kg very thin male ~ 1.9ug/ml \par
\par
\par
Body wate remains constant in health\par
Body Wate is in a "dynamic steady state"\line\par
there is a constant exchange between individual <-> extenal envionment \par
\par
body water also moves interrnally between different compartments\par
\par

\par
Obligatory loses ~ 1.5L / day\par

\tab sensible: urine + stool ~ 0.5L\par

Adult: over 24 hours water turnover is 3-4% of body weight (~2L)\par
Infant: ove 24 hours water turnove is ~10% of body weight\par
\par
The infant is losing a lot of water though passive evaporation because of the higher surface area to volume ratio\par
\par
body water volume is remarkably constant under conditions of health\par
\par

Body water is in a dynamic steady state\par
\par
Water also moves freely between the fluid compartments of the body (internally)\par
\par
60% of total body mass is body water \par
\par
There are 2 Major Compartments\par
\par
1. Intracellular fluid (ICF) (2/3 body water) \par
\tab it is the aggregate of fluid bound by internal surfaces of all cell membranes\par
\tab inside of cells\par
\par
2. Extracelluar fluid (ECF) (1/3 of body water)\par
\par
This can be divided in to major components\par
\par
a. Plasma\par
\tab plasma is the liquid that suspends red blood cells\par
\par
b. Interstitial fluid (ISF)\par
\tab fluid which surrounds individual cells\par
\tab it is the true \ldblquote milieu interieur\rdblquote\par
\tab outside the capillaries\par
\par
and minor components\par
a.  Lymph\par
\tab Blind-ended tubular \par
\tab Lymphatic drainage is one way\par
\tab\par
\tab Related to the lymphatic system \par
\par
\tab 1-2% of ECF\par
\par
b. Transcellular fluid\par
\tab Aggregate of small fluid volumes secreted by specific epithelial cells that line some body cavities\par
\tab Intra-occular\par
\tab Cochlear\par
\tab Peritoneal\par
\tab Locally plays a very important role, but local changes does not affect body fluid overall\par
\tab\par
\tab less than 1-2% of ECF\par

1. The total volume in a compartment remains constant\par
2. Relative Distribution between compartments remains constant\par
\par
Memorize numbers on slides\par
\par
3. Compartments are in a state of dynamic equilibrium\par
\par
Methods to determine compartment volumes\par
\par
1. Direct (will kill organisms)\par
2. Indirect (usually used)\par
\par
How do we measure this directly \par
Indicator dilution method\par
\par
1. Add a known quantity of substance to the volume (introduce known quantity Q)\par
2. Mix (Wait for circulation)\par
3. Take out a small quantity from volume (take some blood)\par
4. Take concentration\par
5. Calculate total volume from level of dilution\par
\par
V = Q/c\par
\par
To do this we inject it into the circulatory system and give it time to circulate\par
\par
How do we choose an indicator\par
\par
1. non-toxic\par
2. diffuse readily and evenly through compartments to be measured\par
3. Introduce no changes in distribution of water between compartments\par
4. Easy to measure its concentration (often radioactive or coloured)\par
\par
To measure total body water must cross from plasma in blood past capillary wall into ISF \par
then goes through cell membrane into cells (ICF)\par
\par
an example is using deutrium oxide (heavy water D2O)\par
\par
Q = 50 ml D20\par
c = 0.001 ml D20 /ml plasma\par
\par
50 000 ml total body water\par
\par
Options to only measure ECF could be radioactive sugars INULIN, SUCROSE \par
Only measure plasma Evans\rquote  blue, Albumin\par
\par
ex q - 200mg Evans\rquote  blue\par
c= 0.055 mg.ml plasma\par
V = 200/0.055 = 3.6L plasma volume\par
\par
In a clinical setting we must correct the amount of Q which has been removed from metabolism or excretion \par
\par
What if we only want to know ICF or ISF?\par
We need to use 2 indicators and then subtract\par
\par
ICF? Total Body Water - ECF - ICF\par
\par
ISF? ECF - Plasma = ISF\par
\par
PROBLEM:\par
Total plasma volume 3L\par
Hematocrit = 40%\par
-> plasma = 60% -> total blood volume 5L\par
\par
ICF - High in K+, low in Na+, Cl-\par
ECF - High in Na+ and Cl-, low in K+\par
\par
we can approximate ECF with 0.9% NaCl \par
9g NaCl in 1L water\par

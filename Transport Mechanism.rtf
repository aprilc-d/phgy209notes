Body contains 3 main compartments\par
ICF ~ 28L \par
--------- cell membrane \par
Insterstitial fluid ~ 11L\par
--------- capillary wall\par
plasma ~ 3L\par
\par
across the cell membrane we have the exchange gases, nutients etc\par
across the capillary wall we have exchange of gases, nutirents etc\par
\par
gases enter the body through the lungs\par
food and water enter through GI tract\par
water extrected through kidnets\par
\par
highly permeable across cell membrane:\par
\tab H20\par
\tab lipid solube subbstances\par
\tab dissolved gases \par
\tab smalll uncharged molecules\par
\par
less permeable:\par
\tab larger molecules\par
\tab charged particles (ions)\par
\par
impermeable:\par
\tab large molecules (protiens, complex carbs)\par
\par
cell membrane is the phospholipid bilayer\par
polar heads, lipid tails\par
6-10nm \par
the cell membrane is amphipathic (polar and non polar ends)\par
phospholipids are 40-50% of cell membane weight\par
\par
An important compenent of the membrane iss cholesterol\par
it functions as a buffer preventing lowe temperatues from inhibiting fluidity and higher temperatue increases increasing fluidity too much \par
\par
Cholesteol is also important in forming vesicles and lipid rafts\par
slightly ampipathic\par
\par
protiens, 25-75% of membrane by weight\par
2 types\par
1. intergral\par
\tab closely associated with phospholipds mostly cross the membrane (trans-membrane)\par
2. perripheral\par
\tab more loosly associated, mostly on cytoplasmic side\par
\par
Glycocalyx is a fuzzy coating that surrongs the cell membrane formed of glycans, glycoprotiens and glycolipids.\par
\par
The glycocalyx contributes to cell-cell recognition, communication, adhesion and protection\par
it helps control vasular pemeability\par
\par
All these things together forms the fluid mosaic model of the cell membane\par
it is a dynamic structure, things are being replenished and replaced constantly\par

\tab via phospholipid bilayerr\par
\tab via interraction with a transmembrane protein (channels, carrier exchanger + transporter (takes ATP))\par
\par
We have 2 types of transport\par
1. passive (energy independent)\par
\tab diffusion\par
\tab facilitated diffusion\par
\tab osmosis\par
2. active (energy dependent)\par
\tab active transport (primary, secondary)\par
\tab pino/phagocytosis\par
\par
diffusion is the movement of moleculkes from one location to another as a result of random thermal motion\par
i.e. put sugar in water, eventually it will evenly disperse through diffusion\par
\par
we define flux as the amount of parrticles crossing a surface per unit time\par
net flux is from high to low concentration\par
at equilibrium diffusion fluxes are equal and net flux is 0 (net movement = 0)\par
diffusion occurs even across a mechanical partition (membrane) as long as it is premeable to the diffusing particles\par
\par
FICK'S LAW OF DIFFUSION \par
J = PA (C0-CI)\par
J: flux: moles of solute crossing a unit area oer unit time (rate of diffusion)\par
P: permeability coefficient: a constant based on ease of which molecule moves through membrane\par
A: surface area of membrane: \par
C0-CI: concentration gradient of the diffusing molecule across the membrane\par
\par
diffusion time increases in proportion to the square of the distance travelled by the solute molecules. Diffusion is an effective transport process only over short distances (Einstein approximation equation)\par
\par
time for glucose diffusion \par
1um = 1ms\par
10um = 100 ms\par
100 um = 10000ms\par
(why we need lots of capillaries)\par
\par
what effects cell membrane diffusion\par
\tab 1. mass of molecule\par
\tab 2. concentration gradient\par
\tab 3. lipid solubility\par
\tab 4. electrical charge\par
\tab 5. ion channels\par
\tab 6. membrane carriers\par
diffusion of nonpolar molecules and gases across the lipid bilayer\par
diffusion of ions through channels\par
\par
---------------\par
Ion channels\par
ion channels are transmembrane proteins that show ion selectivity\line\par
typically 6 transmembrane protiens (at least 4)\par
\par
the movement of ions is also affected by the presence of an electrical gradient. \par
\par
the simulaneous existence of an electrical and a concentration gradient for a particula ion is known as an ELECTROCHEMICAL gradient\par
\tab\par
potassium wants to go outside of the cell because of concentration\par
inside of cell is negative so it pulls K+ inside cell\par
\par
ion channels can exist in open or closed state as they undergo confomational changes\par
this is known as gating.\par
channels may be gated in 3 wyas\par
\tab ligand-gated (ACh)\par
\tab voltage-gated (most we will talk about) (potential difference across membrane)\par
\tab mechanically gated (stress)\par
\par
We mostly care about voltage gated ion channels \par
\tab Na+ (all cells)\par
\tab K+ \par
\tab Ca+ (heart, controls contractions)\par
\tab Cl- (ph regulation, volume regulation)\par
these channels are very selective, they dont let other ions through\par
\par
current flow through single ion channels depends upon:\par
\tab channel conductance\par
\tab channel open time\par
\tab frequency of channel opening\par
\par
--------------------------------------------------------\par
Mediated transport \par
Mediated transport is the movemtntiof ions and other molecules (glucose, amino acidds) by inefral membrane proteins called transporters ir carruers\par
\par
Ion movement across membranes via transporters is much slower than through ion channels\par
1. facilitated diffisuion (passive)\par
2. active transport\par
\tab primary active transport\par
\tab secondary active transport\par
\par
mediated transport is\par
\tab specificity (only move one type of thing)\par
\tab saturation (rrate of transport reaches a maximum when all binding sites on all transporters are occupied) Thus there is alimit, the transport maximum (Tm) across a given  membrane) (seats filled on a bus)\par
\tab competition (occurs when structurally similar substances compete for the same binding site on a carrier membrane)\par
\par
factors that determine mediated transport\par
\tab 1 solute concentration\par
\tab 2. affinity of tranporter for solute\par
\tab 3. numbe of transporters\par
\tab 4. rate of transporter confgormational change\par
\tab\par
FACILITATED DIFFUSION\tab\par
involves the presence of s "transporter" or "carrier" molecule, which enables a solute to penetrate more than it would with only simple diffusion\par
\par
\tab 1. solute binds transporter\par
\tab 2 transporter changes config\par
\tab 3. soluyte is delicered to other side\par
\tab 4 transporter returns to original config\par
\par
transporter mediated\par
passive (no energy)\par
net flux from high to low concentration\par
\par
hormones may increases the number / affinity of transporters in some membrans\par
Glut-4 transports glucose in muscles and is increased by insulin\par
\par
ACTIVE TRANSPORT\par
transport mediated\par
requires supply of chemical energy (usually from APT)\par
susceptible to metabolic inhibtors\par
can transport solute AGAINST its concentration gradient (uphill transport)\par
\par
PRIMARY ACTIVE\tab\par
involves hydrolysis of ATP by transporter\par
ohophorylation of the transporter changes the conformation of the transporter ands its solute binding affinity\par
\par
i.e. K+, Na+ pump\par
inside cell low Na+, high K+\par
outside cell high Na+, low K+\par
important functions make K+ leave cell and Na+ enter so we need to fight gradient to keep k+ high in cell using Na+ K+ pump\par
\par
Other active transporter\par
Ca2+-ATPase maintain low intracelluar Ca2+ levels\par
H+ATPase Maintaiin low lusosomal pH\par
H+/K+-ATPase acidification of stomach\par
\par

\
Body contains 3 main compartments\
ICF ~ 28L \
--------- cell membrane \
Insterstitial fluid ~ 11L\
--------- capillary wall\
plasma ~ 3L\
\
across the cell membrane we have the exchange gases, nutients etc\
across the capillary wall we have exchange of gases, nutirents etc\
\
gases enter the body through the lungs\
food and water enter through GI tract\
water extrected through kidnets\
\
highly permeable across cell membrane:\
	H20\
	lipid solube subbstances\
	dissolved gases \
	smalll uncharged molecules\
\
less permeable:\
	larger molecules\
	charged particles (ions)\
\
impermeable:\
	large molecules (protiens, complex carbs)\
\
cell membrane is the phospholipid bilayer\
polar heads, lipid tails\
6-10nm \
the cell membrane is amphipathic (polar and non polar ends)\
phospholipids are 40-50% of cell membane weight\
\
An important compenent of the membrane iss cholesterol\
it functions as a buffer preventing lowe temperatues from inhibiting fluidity and higher temperatue increases increasing fluidity too much \
\
Cholesteol is also important in forming vesicles and lipid rafts\
slightly ampipathic\
\
protiens, 25-75% of membrane by weight\
2 types\
1. intergral\
	closely associated with phospholipds mostly cross the membrane (trans-membrane)\
2. perripheral\
	more loosly associated, mostly on cytoplasmic side\
\
Glycocalyx is a fuzzy coating that surrongs the cell membrane formed of glycans, glycoprotiens and glycolipids.\
\
The glycocalyx contributes to cell-cell recognition, communication, adhesion and protection\
it helps control vasular pemeability\
\
All these things together forms the fluid mosaic model of the cell membane\
it is a dynamic structure, things are being replenished and replaced constantly\
 \

\
Functions of plasma membrane proteins\
	selective transport (channels and transporters)\
	enzymes (animo acid transport Na-K pump\
	cell surface receptor (G-protein receptor, insulin receptor, ACh receptor)\
	cell surface indentity marker (CD$ T lymphocyctes, CD45 Leucocytes CD68 Monocytes) (immune response)\
	cell adhesion (CAMs cadherins, integrins)\
	attachments to cytoskeleton (actin microtublules septins)\
	cell cell communication \
\
Transmembrane pathways\
	via phospholipid bilayerr\
	via interraction with a transmembrane protein (channels, carrier exchanger + transporter (takes ATP))\
\
We have 2 types of transport\
1. passive (energy independent)\
	diffusion\
	facilitated diffusion\
	osmosis\
2. active (energy dependent)\
	active transport (primary, secondary)\
	pino/phagocytosis\
\
diffusion is the movement of moleculkes from one location to another as a result of random thermal motion\
i.e. put sugar in water, eventually it will evenly disperse through diffusion\
\
we define flux as the amount of parrticles crossing a surface per unit time\
net flux is from high to low concentration\
at equilibrium diffusion fluxes are equal and net flux is 0 (net movement = 0)\
diffusion occurs even across a mechanical partition (membrane) as long as it is premeable to the diffusing particles\
\
FICK'S LAW OF DIFFUSION \
J = PA (C0-CI)\
J: flux: moles of solute crossing a unit area oer unit time (rate of diffusion)\
P: permeability coefficient: a constant based on ease of which molecule moves through membrane\
A: surface area of membrane: \
C0-CI: concentration gradient of the diffusing molecule across the membrane\
\
diffusion time increases in proportion to the square of the distance travelled by the solute molecules. Diffusion is an effective transport process only over short distances (Einstein approximation equation)\
\
time for glucose diffusion \
1um = 1ms\
10um = 100 ms\
100 um = 10000ms\
(why we need lots of capillaries)\
\
what effects cell membrane diffusion\
	1. mass of molecule\
	2. concentration gradient\
	3. lipid solubility\
	4. electrical charge\
	5. ion channels\
	6. membrane carriers\
diffusion of nonpolar molecules and gases across the lipid bilayer\
diffusion of ions through channels\
\
---------------\
Ion channels\
ion channels are transmembrane proteins that show ion selectivity\uc0\u8232 \
typically 6 transmembrane protiens (at least 4)\
\
the movement of ions is also affected by the presence of an electrical gradient. \
\
the simulaneous existence of an electrical and a concentration gradient for a particula ion is known as an ELECTROCHEMICAL gradient\
	\
potassium wants to go outside of the cell because of concentration\
inside of cell is negative so it pulls K+ inside cell\
\
ion channels can exist in open or closed state as they undergo confomational changes\
this is known as gating.\
channels may be gated in 3 wyas\
	ligand-gated (ACh)\
	voltage-gated (most we will talk about) (potential difference across membrane)\
	mechanically gated (stress)\
\
We mostly care about voltage gated ion channels \
	Na+ (all cells)\
	K+ \
	Ca+ (heart, controls contractions)\
	Cl- (ph regulation, volume regulation)\
these channels are very selective, they dont let other ions through\
\
current flow through single ion channels depends upon:\
	channel conductance\
	channel open time\
	frequency of channel opening\
\
--------------------------------------------------------\
Mediated transport \
Mediated transport is the movemtntiof ions and other molecules (glucose, amino acidds) by inefral membrane proteins called transporters ir carruers\
\
Ion movement across membranes via transporters is much slower than through ion channels\
1. facilitated diffisuion (passive)\
2. active transport\
	primary active transport\
	secondary active transport\
\
mediated transport is\
	specificity (only move one type of thing)\
	saturation (rrate of transport reaches a maximum when all binding sites on all transporters are occupied) Thus there is alimit, the transport maximum (Tm) across a given  membrane) (seats filled on a bus)\
	competition (occurs when structurally similar substances compete for the same binding site on a carrier membrane)\
\
factors that determine mediated transport\
	1 solute concentration\
	2. affinity of tranporter for solute\
	3. numbe of transporters\
	4. rate of transporter confgormational change\
	\
FACILITATED DIFFUSION	\
involves the presence of s "transporter" or "carrier" molecule, which enables a solute to penetrate more than it would with only simple diffusion\
\
	1. solute binds transporter\
	2 transporter changes config\
	3. soluyte is delicered to other side\
	4 transporter returns to original config\
\
transporter mediated\
passive (no energy)\
net flux from high to low concentration\
\
hormones may increases the number / affinity of transporters in some membrans\
Glut-4 transports glucose in muscles and is increased by insulin\
\
ACTIVE TRANSPORT\
transport mediated\
requires supply of chemical energy (usually from APT)\
susceptible to metabolic inhibtors\
can transport solute AGAINST its concentration gradient (uphill transport)\
\
PRIMARY ACTIVE TRANSPORT\
involves hydrolysis of ATP by transporter\
Phophorylation of the transporter changes the conformation of the transporter ands its solute binding affinity\
\
i.e. K+, Na+ pump\
inside cell low Na+, high K+\
outside cell high Na+, low K+\
important functions make K+ leave cell and Na+ enter so we need to fight gradient to keep k+ high in cell using Na+ K+ pump\
\
Other active transporter\
Ca2+-ATPase maintain low intracelluar Ca2+ levels\
H+ATPase Maintaiin low lysosomal pH\
H+/K+-ATPase acidification of stomach\

\
SECONDARY ACTIVE TRANSPORT\
the movement of Na+ down its concentration gradient is coupled to the transport of another solute molecule (ion, glucose, amino acid) \
uphill against its concentration gradient. Secondary\
Sodium provides the energy\
\
1. Na+ binds to transporter outside \
\
two types\
symport (cotratransport)\
	when solute X is transported in the same direction as Na+\
Antiport (Countertransport or exchange)\
	when the solute X is trassnported in the oposite direction\
\
\
Symport\
	Na+/HCO3- (NBC)\
	Na+/amino acid (NAcT)\
	Na+/glucose (SGLT) (kidneys, GI tract)\
\
Antiport \
	Na+/H+ (NHE)\
	Na+/Ca2+ (NCX) (we need low calcium in cells)\
\
(add summary table)\

Endocytosis and Exocytosis\
Active transport mechanisms involving participation of the cell membrane\
\
EXOCYTOSIS\
Moving from inside to outside the cell\
\
2 types\
Constitutive exocytosis\
	non regulated. function to replace plasma membrane, deliver membrane proteins to the cell membrane and to get rid of sibstances\
\
ENDOCYTOSIS\
1. Pinocytosis (fluid endocytosis)\
	incolces an endocytotic veicle that engulfs extracellular fluid includinh whatever solutes are present. \
2. Phagocytosis\
\
3. Receptor mediated endocytosis\
	clathrin-dependent receptor-mediated endocytosis\
\
	potocytosis\

Diffusion of WATER\
water diffuses freely across most cell membranes\
this is facilitated by groups of proteins (aquoporins) that form water permeable channel (Peter Agre)\
\
Osmosis is the net diffusion of water across a semipermeable membrane (permeable to solvent but not to all solute)\
55.5 M in 1 L water\
\
\
osmosis is movement of water from lower solute concentration to higher solute concentration\
difference of height in tube is osmotic pressure\
\
the osmotic pressure is the pressure required to \
\
you can approximate this with \
p = nRT/V\
n = number of particles\
R = gas particvles\
T = temp\
\
Osmolaroty (Osm) is the total solute concentration of a solution\
\
1 osmol = 1 mol of solute particles\
1 mol glucose = 1 osmol of solute\
1 mol NaCl = 1 mol Na+ + 1 mol Cl- = 2 osmol\
1 mol MgCl2 = 1 mol Mg2+ + 2 mol Cl- = 3 osmol\
\
Osm = osmol / L\
1 mol glucose/L - 1 osmol/L = 1 Osm\
1 mol NaCl/L = 2 osmol/L = 2 Osm\
\
Osmotic pressure of physiological saline\
1. determine molarity\
 0.9% saline = 0.9 NaCl / 100g H20\
- 9g NaCl / L\
moles 9 g NaCl * 1 mol /58.5g NaCl = 0.15 mol NaCl\
Molarity mol /L 0.15 mol / 1 L = 0.15 M NaCl solution\
\
2. determine osmolarity\
0.15M NaCL solution = 0.15 moles Na+ + 0.15 mol Cl- \
= 0.15 osmol + 0.15osmol = 30 osmol\
=0.3 osmol / L = 0.30 Osm  = 300 mOsm\
\
3. calculate osmotic prssure\
P = 0.3 OSM * 22.4 atm /Osm = 6.7 atm \
= 6.7 * 760 mmHg/atm = \
\
Osmolarity is the total amount of particles dissolved\
solutions which have the same osmolarity aas normal extraceellular are called ISOSOMTIC\
\
Solutions which have an osmolarity lower than 300 mOsm are call HYPOSMTIC\
\
To be effective in exerting a sustained osmotic pressure, particles must not be able to cross the membrane and are referred to as nonpenetrating\
\
Extracellul\
\
\
TONICITY\
swelling and shrinking of cells\
if the solution has a concentration of 300 mOsm of nonpenetrating solute particles there qill be no net shift of water ISOTONIC SOLUTION\
\
if the solution has a concentration of nonpenetrating solute particles less than 300 mOsm, water will enter the cell and the cell will swell HYPOTONIC solution\
\
if we have more than 300 mOsm outside the cell water will leave the cell to make it shrink. this is HYPERTONIC SOLUTION\
